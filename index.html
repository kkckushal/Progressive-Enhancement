<h3>The Story</h3>
<blockquote cite="https://byrslf.co/theres-no-good-nor-bad-85a62f371abc">

 Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <q class= "villagers">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer said,<q class="farmer"><em>Maybe.</em></q>The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,<q class="villagers">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said,<q class="farmer"><em>Maybe.</em></q>

The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said,<q class= "villagers">Oh dear,that’s too <strong class="bad">bad</strong></q> and the farmer responded, <q class= "farmer"><em>Maybe.</em></q> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class= "villagers">Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <q class= farmer><em>Maybe.</em></q>

"The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <strong class="good">good</strong> or <strong class="bad">bad</strong> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <strong class="good">good</strong> fortune."

  <h4>Conclusion: <strong class="good">"Good</strong> and <strong class="bad">Bad</strong> are just one perspective. Bananas are <strong class= "good">good</strong> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <strong class="good">good</strong> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it..."</h4>
